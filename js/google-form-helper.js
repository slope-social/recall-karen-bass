/**
 * How to find Google Form field IDs:
 * 
 * 1. Create your Google Form with all the fields you need
 * 2. Open the Google Form in your browser
 * 3. Right-click on the form and select "View page source" or press Ctrl+U
 * 4. In the source code, search for "entry." to find the field IDs
 * 5. Each form field will have an ID like "entry.123456789"
 * 6. Note down the ID number for each field (e.g., 123456789)
 * 7. Update the field ID mappings in the getGoogleFormFieldId function in main.js
 * 
 * Example:
 * If your Google Form has a "First Name" field with ID "entry.123456789",
 * you would update the petitionFormFieldIds object in main.js like this:
 * 
 * const petitionFormFieldIds = {
 *   firstName: '123456789', // The ID for the First Name field
 *   ...
 * };
 */

/**
 * How to get your Google Form URL:
 * 
 * 1. Create your Google Form
 * 2. Click the "Send" button
 * 3. Click the link icon (chain icon)
 * 4. Copy the form URL
 * 5. Modify the URL to get the form submission URL:
 *    - Replace "/viewform" with "/formResponse" at the end of the URL
 * 
 * Example:
 * Original URL: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/viewform
 * Submission URL: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/formResponse
 * 
 * Update the googleFormUrl variables in the form submission handlers in main.js with these URLs.
 */

/**
 * Important Notes:
 * 
 * 1. Google Forms has CORS restrictions, so we use 'mode: "no-cors"' in the fetch request.
 *    This means we won't get a proper response back, so we assume success if there's no error.
 * 
 * 2. Make sure your Google Form is set to collect email addresses if you want to track who submitted the form.
 * 
 * 3. Test your form submission thoroughly to ensure data is being correctly submitted to Google Forms.
 * 
 * 4. If you have checkbox fields in your form, you'll need to handle them specially.
 *    Google Forms expects checkbox values to be submitted as separate entries with the same field ID.

/**
 * Utility function to help extract Google Form field IDs
 * 
 * How to use:
 * 1. Open your Google Form in the browser
 * 2. Open the browser console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
 * 3. Copy and paste the following code into the console:
 * 
 * ```
 * // First, create a function to extract field IDs
 * function extractGoogleFormFieldIds() {
 *   const formElement = document.querySelector('form');
 *   if (!formElement) {
 *     console.error('No form element found on this page');
 *     return;
 *   }
 *   
 *   const fieldMappings = {};
 *   const inputs = formElement.querySelectorAll('input, textarea, select');
 *   
 *   inputs.forEach(input => {
 *     const name = input.getAttribute('name');
 *     if (name && name.startsWith('entry.')) {
 *       const fieldId = name.replace('entry.', '');
 *       const label = input.closest('.freebirdFormviewerComponentsQuestionBaseRoot')
 *         ?.querySelector('.freebirdFormviewerComponentsQuestionBaseTitle')
 *         ?.textContent.trim() || 'Unknown Field';
 *       
 *       fieldMappings[label] = fieldId;
 *     }
 *   });
 *   
 *   console.log('Google Form Field IDs:');
 *   console.log(JSON.stringify(fieldMappings, null, 2));
 *   
 *   return fieldMappings;
 * }
 * 
 * // Then run the function
 * extractGoogleFormFieldIds();
 * ```
 * 
 * 4. The console will output a JSON object with field labels and their corresponding IDs
 * 5. Use these IDs to update the field mappings in main.js
